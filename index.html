        <p>Harry and Meghan's seccession from the royal family has made them two of the most unpopular in the UK's royal family league table (placed just above a serial-rapist).</p>
        <p>The UK tabloids have it in for Meghan. A senior editor I used to work under at the Sunday Times would regularly refer to her as "that bloody woman". And the angle taken by the dailies often sets the tone for public opinion. 
        </p>
        <p>For all Meghan Markle's attention-seeking, she could have been the monarchy's best asset. She's modern, woke, interested in good causes. Shouldn't those be redeeming qualities for a 21st-century monarchy?</p>
        <p>But everyone loves the dutiful, motherly Kate Middleton, happily-married to Prince William and scandal-free for the past decade. So what has Kate got that Meghan doesn't?</p>
        <p>For this project, I scraped every headline and image caption for the two women in 2023 from the Daily Mail (a tabloid with the highest circulation in the UK, notorious for crude writing and misogyny).</p>
        <br>
        <p>It took a while.</p>

        </div>
        <p>According to an NLTK natural language processor I ran the data through (you can find all my working <a href="https://github.com/Colvap/Project-2-">here</a>), the word choices used around Meghan were much more negative than those used around Kate. That makes sense, with the scandals surrounding Meghan this year, especially after Prince Harry's rift with his brother.</p>
        <p>Maybe the twenty most-used adjectives, verbs and nouns used around the two will tell us something about what Brits expect from young royal women.</p>

        <p>The Princess of Wales has a large number of adjectives in her word cloud, editors choosing to praise her as 'dazzling' and 'elegant', focusing on her position as a mother, with 'children', 'family' and 'wedding' topping the list.</p> 
        <p>Her verbs are fairly passive, likely due to all her public appearances covered by the Mail, often <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12210831/Polka-dot-princess-Kate-radiant-Alessandra-Rich-dress-arrives-Garter-Day.html">fawning</a> over her 'radiant' clothes. The formula is how she 'appeared' on her 'visit' somewhere, and 'looked' wonderful 'wearing' something as she 'chatted' to her many fans.</p>
        <p>I thought it was strange they mentioned her age - 41 - so often. Initially I interpreted this as evidence of obsession with female ageing, but it turns out to be an editorial standard - all figures written about under the Mail's 'news' section have their ages mentioned.</p>
        <p>Meghan, meanwhile, has all her articles listed under 'showbiz':</p>

            <p>Verbs are used more often for Meghan than Kate, showing the former's agency. These verbs are more active and pugnacious, like 'told', 'spotted' and 'claimed'.</p>
            <p>Like Kate, many of Meghan's nouns indicate interest in her as a spouse, like 'wife' and 'wedding'. But they also highlight her activism: 'Oprah', 'Netflix', 'interview'.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile her adjectives are more associated with disputes: 'reportedly', 'controversial', 'explosive'.</p>
    </div>
<p>In Netflix's 'The Crown', a leitmotif is how the royal family's greatest successes are those who are most passive. As the formidable Eileen Atkins (playing the old Queen Mary) says to a fresh-faced Queen Elizabeth II, 'the less you do, the less you say, the better.'</p>
<p>It seems that, to win the hearts of Middle England as a royal, it still pays to be passive.</p>
