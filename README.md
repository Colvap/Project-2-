# Project-2
 
This project scraped all headlines and image captions published by the Daily Mail so far this year, concerning Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. 

I scraped the word data with BeautifulSoup, then ran it through NLTK software to remove common small words, and calculate the frequency of different types of words. I discounted any words that were part of royal names of places, as well as standard news-speak ('said','first', 'last', etc.). I then manually transferred the data to an excel spreadsheet and created some word clouds with Tableau. For some extra fun, I created a gif and image grid to accompany the presentation.

My aim was to practice data scraping, which I am new to, so thought I would start with something small and manageable...but navigating sitemaps and tracking errors proved a big challenge. If I had had more time I would have tried to calculate the exact negative score of words associated with Meghan, vs those of Kate. I also wanted to tailor my wordclouds with Figma, but I had problems converting my the PNGs to SVGs, meaning alterations on Figma went awry. 

Next time, I would like to spend more time working on presentation, and engage a little in my subject matter (China).
